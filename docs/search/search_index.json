Beginning March 4, I will regularly post a playlist of tutorial videos for the upcoming week by each Friday. I will post the playlist as early as possible, but it could arrive by noon or a little after . If you subscribe to the playlist on YouTube, you will receive notifications when new videos become published. The playlist will demonstrate methods relevant to lectures of the upcoming week. Please plan to work through videos within one week of posting. Thank you.

What makes a map design work? What is timeless about maps and their design? In this course we will explore these questions through a series of practical exercises, readings, discussions, and critiques. We will learn fundamental concepts, principles, and patterns for using graphics to depict geographical ideas and support geographical thinking. We will practice and compare methods for making static and dynamic maps, including QGIS, Adobe CS, and Mapbox Studio, and compare frameworks and methods for evaluating map style and documenting map design.","title":"Description"},{"location":"evaluation/","text":"Your final grade will be based on your participation in the course and your work on three map projects. COMPONENT EXPECTATION WEIGHT Participation Attend all class meetings, complete all readings, participate in all crits, meet all deadlines. Provide prior notice if you must miss a meeting or need extra time on a project. Step penalty (e.g. A becomes A-) on project grade for each infraction. Monochrome map Develop a static, single hue reference map for a location of your choice. Document design with a map taxonomy sheet and a 500 - 750 word explanation of motivation and design choices. \u2153 final grade Storyline map Develop a static thematic map that tells a story about a journey and a place. Document design with a map taxonomy sheet and a 500 - 750 word explanation of motivation and design choices. \u2153 final grade Slippy map Design a slippy map inspired by a print map style or other non-digital medium. Document design with a map taxonomy sheet and a 500 - 750 word explanation of motivation and design choices. \u2153 final grade","title":"Final grades"},{"location":"monochrome/","text":"Required deliverables Three deliverables: Map layout Map taxonomy sheet Design narrative The static map layout should illustrate an idea about a place with the following constraints: monochrome (color palette restricted to white or a light hue for paper and a single hue for \u201cink\u201d, which can grade from light to dark); data from Open Street Map (or 1 for 1 substitutions); scale (RF) should be between 1:50,000 and 1:100,000; size of mapped geography at least 16\u201d in one dimension. You will also document your design with a map taxonomy sheet and a 500 - 750 word explanation of design decisions (including but not limited to purpose, audience, and media). The three deliverables (map layout, style sheet, design narrative) should all be in digital format (either .pdf or .png). Recommended journal I strongly encourage you to keep a journal while you work on this project. Not so much when you work through the tutorials that I give you, but when you start to apply those methods to your own work. Try to reserve a few minutes at the end of a work session to write down what you tried to accomplish, the main decisions that you needed to make, and your thoughts about how your solutions worked or could work better. This running commentary on your design process will likely help you write the short narrative explaining your design decisions that is a required deliverable of the project. Professionally/beyond college, a journal will also help you track and report your work hours and prepare for feedback from colleagues. You can journal by hand or use something like a Google doc. Ideally, you will also use the journal as a scrapbook to collect pictures of ideas that you can incorporate in your work. Please note that journaling is recommended but not required for this project and I will not evaluate your work on this. You may find that developing a habit of journaling a little bit while your work will save you time at the end of the project and improve the quality of your work. Map layout examples The examples below are from MonoCarto 2019 (see also this article ), a monochrome map competition organized by the great Daniel Huffman. Please note that these examples are not restricted to OSM data, but they do illustrate the monochrome palette constraint. I find them inspiring and hope that you do too.

The layout and documentation are largely flawless. A- Outstanding. The layout and documentation have most of the characteristics of \u201cA\u201d work, but with a couple of small flaws. B+ Very good. A simple layout (small number of elements and/or generic theme) done well or a more ambitious layout with both strengths and weaknesses. In either case, documentation materials are largely excellent but may have some opportunities to improve. B Good. A simple layout with both strengths and weaknesses, or an ambitious layout with many opportunities to improve. Documentation materials may have both strengths and weaknesses. B- OK. A simple layout where opportunities to improve outnumber demonstrated strengths. Documentation materials also show strengths and weaknesses. C Fraught with problems. With little or nothing to commend. F Failure to finish.","title":"Project grades"},{"location":"slippy/","text":"Create a slippy map based on static map design, including historical maps and non-paper materials.

Adobe is not open source, but as a Middlebury student it is free for you to install on your personal laptop. (Please install Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe InDesign). Mapbox studio is a cloud service. You can sign up for a free account and use it as long as you are connected to the internet. Though QGIS and Adobe CS are both available on computers in the Geography Dept computer lab (MBH 632), installing this software on your personal computer will give you greater flexibility should you need to quarantine or should our modality shift abruptly. It will also allow you to use class meeting time to work on your projects.","title":"Toolshed"}]}
